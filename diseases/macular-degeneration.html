                <h2>What Is Age-Related Macular Degeneration?</h2>
                <p>Age-Related Macular Degeneration (AMD or ARMD) is a progressive eye disease that affects the macula,
                    the central part of the retina responsible for sharp, detailed central vision. AMD is the leading
                    cause of severe, permanent vision loss in adults over age 60 in developed countries, affecting
                    millions of people worldwide.</p>

                <p>The disease damages the macula, causing a gradual or sometimes sudden loss of central vision needed
                    for activities like reading, recognizing faces, driving, and seeing fine details. While AMD rarely
                    causes complete blindness—peripheral (side) vision usually remains intact—the loss of central vision
                    can significantly impact quality of life and independence.</p>

                <div class="key-facts">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Key Facts About AMD</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leading cause of vision loss:</strong> AMD is the #1 cause of blindness in people
                            over 65 in Western countries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Progressive disease:</strong> AMD typically worsens over time, though the rate of
                            progression varies widely.</li>
                        <li><strong>Central vision loss:</strong> AMD affects central vision but typically spares
                            peripheral vision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Age-related:</strong> Risk increases dramatically after age 60, though it can occur
                            earlier.</li>
                        <li><strong>Two forms:</strong> Dry AMD (90% of cases) progresses slowly; wet AMD (10%) is more
                            severe but treatable.</li>
                        <li><strong>Non-reversible:</strong> Damage from AMD cannot be reversed, but treatments can slow
                            progression.</li>
                        <li><strong>Both eyes affected:</strong> AMD usually affects both eyes, though often
                            asymmetrically.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Early detection is crucial because treatments exist that can significantly slow disease progression,
                    particularly for wet AMD. Understanding your risk factors and monitoring your vision regularly can
                    help preserve your sight.</p>

            <section id="anatomy">
                <h2>Understanding the Macula and Retina</h2>
                <p>To understand AMD, it's essential to know how the macula functions:</p>

                <h3>The Retina</h3>
                <p>The retina is a thin layer of light-sensitive tissue lining the back of your eye. It contains
                    millions of photoreceptor cells (rods and cones) that convert light into electrical signals, which
                    travel through the optic nerve to your brain where they're interpreted as images.</p>

                <h3>The Macula</h3>
                <p>The macula is a small, specialized area at the center of the retina, about 5mm in diameter. Despite
                    its small size, the macula is responsible for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Central vision:</strong> What you see when you look directly at something</li>
                    <li><strong>Fine detail:</strong> Reading, recognizing faces, threading a needle</li>
                    <li><strong>Color vision:</strong> The macula contains the highest concentration of cone cells
                        responsible for color perception</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>The Fovea</h3>
                <p>At the center of the macula is the fovea, an even tinier area responsible for the sharpest vision.
                    The fovea contains only cone cells packed very densely together.</p>

                <h3>What Happens in AMD?</h3>
                <p>In AMD, cellular debris called drusen accumulates beneath the retina, and the delicate cells of the
                    macula become damaged and die. The retinal pigment epithelium (RPE)—a layer of cells that nourishes
                    the retina—stops working properly. This leads to progressive deterioration of the macula and loss of
                    central vision.</p>
            </section>

            <section id="types">
                <h2>Types of AMD: Dry vs. Wet</h2>
                <p>AMD exists in two distinct forms, each with different characteristics and treatment approaches:</p>

                <h3>Dry AMD (Non-Neovascular, Atrophic AMD)</h3>
                <p>Dry AMD accounts for about 85-90% of all AMD cases. It's characterized by the presence of drusen
                    (yellow deposits under the retina) and gradual thinning of the macula.</p>

                <h4>Characteristics of Dry AMD:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Slow, gradual progression over many years</li>
                    <li>Drusen (tiny yellow or white deposits) accumulate under the retina</li>
                    <li>Gradual break down of light-sensitive cells in the macula</li>
                    <li>Macula becomes thinner (atrophy) over time</li>
                    <li>Usually affects both eyes, though often asymmetrically</li>
                    <li>May or may not progress to wet AMD</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Types of Drusen:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Small drusen:</strong> Normal age-related changes, minimal risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Medium drusen:</strong> Moderate risk for AMD progression</li>
                    <li><strong>Large drusen:</strong> Higher risk, often indicates intermediate AMD</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Geographic Atrophy:</h4>
                <p>The advanced stage of dry AMD is called geographic atrophy, where patches of the retinal tissue waste
                    away, creating well-defined areas of vision loss. This form progresses slowly but causes significant
                    central vision loss.</p>

                <h3>Wet AMD (Neovascular, Exudative AMD)</h3>
                <p>Wet AMD accounts for only 10-15% of AMD cases but causes about 90% of severe vision loss from AMD.
                    It's characterized by abnormal blood vessel growth beneath the retina.</p>

                <h4>Characteristics of Wet AMD:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Rapid progression—can cause severe vision loss in days to weeks</li>
                    <li>Abnormal blood vessels grow under the macula (choroidal neovascularization)</li>
                    <li>These blood vessels leak fluid and blood into the retina</li>
                    <li>Causes swelling and damage to the macula</li>
                    <li>Can lead to scarring if untreated</li>
                    <li>More treatable than dry AMD with current therapies</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Development:</h4>
                <p>Wet AMD typically develops from dry AMD, though not everyone with dry AMD progresses to the wet form.
                    About 10-15% of people with dry AMD eventually develop wet AMD in one or both eyes. Once wet AMD
                    develops in one eye, there's a higher risk of it developing in the other eye.</p>

                    <h4><i class="fas fa-exclamation-triangle"></i> Important: Early Treatment Crucial for Wet AMD</h4>
                    <p>Wet AMD is a medical urgency (though not always an emergency). Early treatment with anti-VEGF
                        injections can preserve vision and sometimes improve it. If you notice sudden changes in your
                        vision, contact your eye doctor immediately—treatment within days can make a significant
                        difference in outcomes.</p>

            <section id="stages">
                <h2>Stages and Progression of AMD</h2>
                <p>AMD is classified into three stages based on the size and number of drusen and the presence of
                    retinal changes:</p>

                <h3>Early AMD</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medium-sized drusen present</li>
                    <li>No vision loss or symptoms</li>
                    <li>Detected only through eye examination</li>
                    <li>Low risk of progression to advanced AMD (about 1% over 5 years)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Management:</strong> Regular monitoring, lifestyle modifications, and protective measures.
                </p>

                <h3>Intermediate AMD</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Large drusen and/or pigment changes in the retina</li>
                    <li>May have mild vision loss but often no symptoms</li>
                    <li>Some people notice difficulty adapting to low light</li>
                    <li>Moderate risk of progression (about 18% over 5 years)</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Management:</strong> AREDS2 vitamins, close monitoring, lifestyle changes, and using an
                    Amsler grid at home.</p>

                <h3>Late/Advanced AMD</h3>
                <p>This stage involves either:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Geographic atrophy (dry AMD):</strong> Breakdown of retinal cells causing distinct
                        patches of vision loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Neovascular AMD (wet AMD):</strong> Abnormal blood vessel growth with leakage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Both forms cause significant central vision loss.</p>
                <p><strong>Management:</strong> Treatment for wet AMD with anti-VEGF injections; low vision
                    rehabilitation; AREDS2 vitamins for the unaffected eye.</p>

                <h3>Rate of Progression</h3>
                <p>Progression varies widely:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Some people remain in early stages for decades</li>
                    <li>Others progress to advanced AMD within a few years</li>
                    <li>Wet AMD can progress very rapidly without treatment</li>
                    <li>Having AMD in one eye increases risk in the other eye</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="causes">
                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>AMD is a complex disease resulting from a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle
                    factors:</p>

                <h3>Non-Modifiable Risk Factors</h3>

                <h4>Age</h4>
                <p>Age is the strongest risk factor. AMD is rare before age 55 but increases dramatically with age:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Age 55-64: About 2% have AMD</li>
                    <li>Age 65-74: About 6-7% have AMD</li>
                    <li>Age 75+: About 15-30% have AMD</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Genetics and Family History</h4>
                <p>Genetics play a major role in AMD risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Family history increases risk 3-6 times</li>
                    <li>Several genes associated with AMD have been identified (including CFH, ARMS2, C3)</li>
                    <li>Genetic testing is available but not routinely recommended</li>
                    <li>Having a first-degree relative with AMD significantly increases your risk</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Race and Ethnicity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Caucasians have the highest risk</li>
                    <li>Lower risk in African Americans and Hispanics</li>
                    <li>Intermediate risk in Asians</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Gender</h4>
                <p>Women have a slightly higher risk than men, possibly due to longer life expectancy.</p>

                <h3>Modifiable Risk Factors</h3>

                <h4>Smoking</h4>
                <p>Smoking is the most significant modifiable risk factor:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Current smokers have 2-3 times higher risk</li>
                    <li>Risk increases with pack-years of smoking</li>
                    <li>Quitting reduces risk over time, though it may take years</li>
                    <li>Secondhand smoke exposure may also increase risk</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cardiovascular Health</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>High blood pressure</li>
                    <li>High cholesterol</li>
                    <li>Atherosclerosis</li>
                    <li>History of heart disease or stroke</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Obesity</h4>
                <p>Being overweight or obese, especially with excess abdominal fat, increases AMD risk and progression.
                </p>

                <h4>Diet and Nutrition</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diet high in saturated fats may increase risk</li>
                    <li>Low intake of antioxidants and omega-3 fatty acids may increase risk</li>
                    <li>Diet low in green leafy vegetables and fish associated with higher risk</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Sun Exposure</h4>
                <p>Chronic exposure to UV and blue light may contribute to AMD, though evidence is mixed.</p>

                <h4>Eye Color</h4>
                <p>People with light-colored eyes (blue or green) may have slightly higher risk.</p>

            <section id="diagnosis">
                <h2>Diagnosis and Testing</h2>
                <p>AMD is diagnosed through a comprehensive dilated eye examination and specialized imaging tests:</p>

                <h3>Comprehensive Eye Exam</h3>

                <h4>1. Visual Acuity Test</h4>
                <p>Measures how well you can see at various distances using an eye chart.</p>

                <h4>2. Dilated Eye Exam</h4>
                <p>After dilating your pupils, your doctor examines the retina and macula for signs of AMD:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Drusen (yellow deposits)</li>
                    <li>Pigment changes</li>
                    <li>Areas of atrophy</li>
                    <li>Hemorrhages or fluid accumulation (wet AMD)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Amsler Grid Test</h4>
                <p>You look at a grid pattern and report any distortions, wavy lines, or missing areas—signs that may
                    indicate wet AMD.</p>

                <h3>Advanced Imaging Tests</h3>

                <h4>Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h4>
                <p>The gold standard for AMD diagnosis and monitoring. OCT uses light waves to create detailed
                    cross-sectional images of the retina, showing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retinal thickness</li>
                    <li>Fluid accumulation</li>
                    <li>Drusen size and characteristics</li>
                    <li>Geographic atrophy</li>
                    <li>Subtle changes over time</li>
                </ul>
                <p>OCT is painless, non-invasive, and takes only minutes.</p>

                <h4>Fluorescein Angiography (FA)</h4>
                <p>Used primarily when wet AMD is suspected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>A fluorescent dye is injected into a vein in your arm</li>
                    <li>As the dye travels through blood vessels in your eye, photographs are taken</li>
                    <li>Reveals abnormal blood vessel growth and leakage</li>
                    <li>Helps determine treatment approach</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>OCT Angiography (OCTA)</h4>
                <p>A newer, non-invasive imaging technique that shows blood flow in the retina without injecting dye.
                </p>

                <h4>Fundus Autofluorescence (FAF)</h4>
                <p>Detects changes in the retinal pigment epithelium, useful for tracking dry AMD progression.</p>

                <h4>Color Fundus Photography</h4>
                <p>Photographs of your retina create a baseline for comparison in future visits.</p>

            <section id="treatment">
                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>Treatment varies significantly between dry and wet AMD:</p>

                <h3>Treatment for Dry AMD</h3>
                <p>Currently, there's no cure or FDA-approved treatment to reverse dry AMD. However, interventions can
                    slow progression:</p>

                <h4>AREDS2 Vitamins</h4>
                <p>The Age-Related Eye Disease Study 2 (AREDS2) found that a specific combination of vitamins and
                    minerals can reduce the risk of progression to advanced AMD in people with intermediate or advanced
                    AMD in one eye:</p>

                <p><strong>AREDS2 Formula:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Vitamin C: 500 mg</li>
                    <li>Vitamin E: 400 IU</li>
                    <li>Lutein: 10 mg</li>
                    <li>Zeaxanthin: 2 mg</li>
                    <li>Zinc: 80 mg (as zinc oxide)</li>
                    <li>Copper: 2 mg (as cupric oxide)</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Important notes:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Only recommended for intermediate or advanced AMD—not early AMD</li>
                    <li>Slows but doesn't stop progression</li>
                    <li>Widely available as over-the-counter supplements labeled "AREDS2"</li>
                    <li>Talk to your doctor before starting, especially if you smoke (high-dose beta-carotene increases
                        lung cancer risk in smokers)</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Emerging Treatments for Geographic Atrophy</h4>
                <p>In 2023, the FDA approved the first treatments for geographic atrophy:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Pegcetacoplan (Syfovre):</strong> Injected into the eye every 25-60 days</li>
                    <li><strong>Avacincaptad pegol (Izervay):</strong> Injected monthly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>These medications slow (but don't stop) the growth of geographic atrophy. Discuss with your retina
                    specialist if you have advanced dry AMD.</p>

                <h3>Treatment for Wet AMD</h3>
                <p>Wet AMD is much more treatable, and early intervention can preserve or even improve vision:</p>

                <h4>Anti-VEGF Injections</h4>
                <p>The primary treatment for wet AMD, anti-VEGF (vascular endothelial growth factor) medications stop
                    abnormal blood vessel growth and reduce fluid leakage:</p>

                <p><strong>Common anti-VEGF medications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aflibercept (Eylea):</strong> Usually given every 4-8 weeks initially</li>
                    <li><strong>Ranibizumab (Lucentis):</strong> Typically monthly injections</li>
                    <li><strong>Brolucizumab (Beovu):</strong> May allow for longer intervals between injections</li>
                    <li><strong>Bevacizumab (Avastin):</strong> Off-label use, less expensive option</li>
                    <li><strong>Faricimab (Vabysmo):</strong> Newer medication allowing extended dosing intervals</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Injections are given in the office setting</li>
                    <li>Eye is numbed with drops—procedure is usually painless</li>
                    <li>Takes only a few minutes</li>
                    <li>Initial "loading phase" of monthly injections for 3 months</li>
                    <li>Maintenance injections as needed, guided by OCT monitoring</li>
                    <li>Treatment is often lifelong</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Effectiveness:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>About 90% of patients maintain vision</li>
                    <li>About 30-40% experience vision improvement</li>
                    <li>Best results when treatment starts early</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Photodynamic Therapy (PDT)</h4>
                <p>Less commonly used now, PDT involves:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Injecting a light-sensitive drug (verteporfin) into your bloodstream</li>
                    <li>Activating the drug with a laser applied to the abnormal blood vessels</li>
                    <li>Sometimes combined with anti-VEGF therapy</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Laser Photocoagulation</h4>
                <p>Rarely used today, high-energy laser destroys abnormal blood vessels. It causes a permanent blind
                    spot and is only used for specific cases away from the center of the macula.</p>
