                <h2>What Is Myopia?</h2>
                <p>Myopia, commonly known as nearsightedness, is a refractive error where distant objects appear blurry
                    while close objects can be seen clearly. It occurs when the eye grows too long from front to back,
                    or when the cornea (the clear front surface of the eye) is too curved. This causes light rays to
                    focus in front of the retina instead of directly on it, resulting in blurred distance vision.</p>

                <p>Myopia is the most common refractive error worldwide and its prevalence is increasing dramatically.
                    While it typically begins in childhood and progresses through the teenage years, myopia can develop
                    at any age and in varying degrees of severity.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Key Facts About Myopia</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Extremely common:</strong> Affects about 30% of the U.S. population and up to 90% in
                            some Asian countries.</li>
                        <li><strong>Increasing prevalence:</strong> Expected to affect 50% of the world's population by
                            2050 (5 billion people).</li>
                        <li><strong>Usually starts in childhood:</strong> Typically develops between ages 6-14 and
                            progresses until early 20s.</li>
                        <li><strong>Easily corrected:</strong> Glasses, contact lenses, or refractive surgery provide
                            clear vision.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hereditary component:</strong> Children with myopic parents are at higher risk.</li>
                        <li><strong>Not just an inconvenience:</strong> High myopia increases risk of serious eye
                            conditions like retinal detachment.</li>
                        <li><strong>Can be slowed:</strong> Myopia control strategies can reduce progression in
                            children.</li>
                        <li><strong>Lifelong condition:</strong> Once myopic, always myopic, though prescription
                            stabilizes in adulthood.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Understanding myopia, its causes, and treatment options is important for maintaining good vision and
                    eye health. Early detection and intervention, especially in children, can help slow progression and
                    reduce the risk of sight-threatening complications later in life.</p>

                <h2>How Vision Works—And What Goes Wrong in Myopia</h2>

                <h3>Normal Vision (Emmetropia)</h3>
                <p>In a normal eye, light enters through the cornea and pupil, is focused by the lens, and converges
                    precisely on the retina at the back of the eye. The retina converts light into electrical signals
                    sent to the brain via the optic nerve, creating the images we see.</p>

                <p><strong>Key components:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Cornea:</strong> Provides about 2/3 of the eye's focusing power</li>
                    <li><strong>Lens:</strong> Fine-tunes focus for different distances</li>
                    <li><strong>Retina:</strong> Light-sensitive tissue that captures images</li>
                    <li><strong>Axial length:</strong> Distance from front to back of eye (normally ~23-24mm)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>What Happens in Myopia</h3>
                <p>In myopia, light focuses in front of the retina instead of on it, causing distant objects to appear
                    blurry. This occurs due to:</p>

                <h4>1. Axial Myopia (Most Common)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>The eyeball is too long from front to back</li>
                    <li>Even with normal corneal curvature and lens power, light focuses too early</li>
                    <li>Accounts for most myopia cases</li>
                    <li>Each 1mm of extra length adds about -3 diopters of myopia</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Refractive Myopia (Less Common)</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cornea is too curved or lens has excessive focusing power</li>
                    <li>Normal axial length, but too much refractive power</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Why Close Objects Are Clear</h3>
                <p>Close objects produce diverging light rays that naturally focus farther back. In myopia, these rays
                    converge perfectly on the retina, which is why near vision remains clear without correction.</p>

                <h3>Measuring Myopia</h3>
                <p>Myopia is measured in diopters (D), indicated by a minus (-) sign:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Low myopia:</strong> -0.25 to -3.00 D</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate myopia:</strong> -3.00 to -6.00 D</li>
                    <li><strong>High myopia:</strong> -6.00 D or greater</li>
                    <li><strong>Extreme/pathological myopia:</strong> -10.00 D or greater</li>
                </ul>

            </section>

            <section id="causes">
                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>Myopia results from a combination of genetic and environmental factors:</p>

                <h3>Genetic Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Parental myopia (strongest risk factor):</strong>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Neither parent myopic: 7-15% risk</li>
                            <li>One parent myopic: 25-40% risk</li>
                            <li>Both parents myopic: 33-60% risk</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Multiple genes involved:</strong> Over 40 genetic loci identified</li>
                    <li><strong>Ethnicity:</strong> Higher prevalence in East Asian populations</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Environmental Factors (Increasingly Important)</h3>

                <h4>Excessive Near Work</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Reading, studying, computer use, smartphones</li>
                    <li>Extended close-up visual tasks</li>
                    <li>Sustained accommodation (focusing effort) may stimulate eye growth</li>
                    <li>Particularly impactful during childhood development</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Lack of Outdoor Time (Major Factor)</h4>
                <p>Growing evidence shows outdoor time is protective:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Children spending < 1 hour/day outdoors:</strong> Much higher myopia rates</li>
                    <li><strong>2+ hours/day outdoors:</strong> Significantly reduced myopia risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Bright light exposure:</strong> May trigger dopamine release in retina, slowing eye
                        growth</li>
                    <li><strong>Distance viewing:</strong> Relaxes focusing mechanism</li>
                    <li>Effect is preventive (reduces onset), not curative</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Education and Socioeconomic Status</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Higher education levels correlate with higher myopia rates</li>
                    <li>College graduates: ~50% myopia</li>
                    <li>Urban vs. rural: Urban children have higher rates</li>
                    <li>Likely related to indoor lifestyle and near work</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other Contributing Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Age of onset:</strong> Earlier onset often leads to higher final myopia</li>
                    <li><strong>Birth factors:</strong> Premature birth, low birth weight increase risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Poor lighting:</strong> May contribute (controversial)</li>
                    <li><strong>Sleep:</strong> Insufficient sleep may increase risk</li>
                    <li><strong>Diet:</strong> Some evidence linking certain nutrients to myopia development</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medical Conditions Associated with Myopia</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Diabetes (fluctuating blood sugar affects lens)</li>
                    <li>Down syndrome</li>
                    <li>Marfan syndrome</li>
                    <li>Ehlers-Danlos syndrome</li>

                    <li>Results recorded as fraction (20/20, 20/40, etc.)</li>
                    <li>Uncorrected myopia shows reduced distance acuity</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Refraction Assessment</h4>
                <p>Determines the precise lens prescription needed:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Autorefractor:</strong> Automated device provides starting point</li>
                    <li><strong>Phoropter:</strong> Doctor flips through lenses while asking "better 1 or 2?"</li>
                    <li><strong>Retinoscopy:</strong> Manual technique using light to determine prescription</li>
                    <li>Determines sphere (myopia/hyperopia), cylinder (astigmatism), and axis</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Cycloplegic Refraction (Children)</h4>
                <ul>

                <h2>Complications of High Myopia</h2>
                <p>High myopia (especially > -6.00 D) increases risk of serious eye problems:</p>

                <h3>Retinal Detachment</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Risk:</strong> 10x higher in high myopia</li>
                    <li>Longer eye stretches and thins retina</li>
                    <li>Can cause permanent vision loss if not treated urgently</li>
                    <li><strong>Symptoms:</strong> Floaters, flashes, curtain over vision</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Myopic Macular Degeneration</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leading cause of vision loss in high myopia</li>
                    <li>Stretching damages central retina (macula)</li>
                    <li>Causes progressive central vision loss</li>
                    <li>No cure; early detection important</li>

                <h3>Glaucoma</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>2-3x higher risk in myopes</li>
                    <li>Optic nerve damage from high eye pressure or other factors</li>
                    <li>Can cause peripheral vision loss</li>
                    <li>Regular screening important</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Cataracts</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develop earlier in myopes</li>
                    <li>Especially posterior subcapsular cataracts</li>

                    <li><strong>Lattice degeneration:</strong> Retinal thinning</li>
                    <li><strong>Posterior staphyloma:</strong> Outpouching of eye wall</li>
                    <li><strong>Increased floaters</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Importance of Regular Monitoring</h3>
                <p>High myopes should have:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Annual dilated eye exams</li>
                    <li>Immediate evaluation if new symptoms (flashes, floaters, vision changes)</li>
                    <li>Regular screening for glaucoma</li>
                    <li>Monitoring of macula</li>
