                <h2>What Is Diabetic Retinopathy?</h2>
                <p>Diabetic retinopathy (DR) is a serious diabetes complication that affects the blood vessels in the
                    retina—the light-sensitive tissue at the back of the eye. It is the leading cause of new cases of
                    blindness among adults aged 20-74 in developed countries. The condition develops when chronically
                    high blood sugar levels damage the tiny blood vessels in the retina, causing them to leak fluid,
                    bleed, or grow abnormally.</p>

                <p>The critical aspect of diabetic retinopathy is that it often develops with no early warning signs. By
                    the time symptoms appear, the disease may already be advanced. However, with proper diabetes
                    management and regular eye exams, diabetic retinopathy can be prevented or its progression
                    significantly slowed.</p>

                    <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Key Facts About Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Leading cause of blindness:</strong> DR is the #1 cause of new blindness in
                            working-age adults in the United States.</li>
                        <li><strong>Affects all diabetics:</strong> Both Type 1 and Type 2 diabetes can lead to diabetic
                            retinopathy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Duration matters:</strong> The longer you have diabetes, the higher your risk—nearly
                            all people with Type 1 diabetes and >60% with Type 2 diabetes will develop some degree of
                            retinopathy after 20 years.</li>
                        <li><strong>Often asymptomatic early:</strong> You may have diabetic retinopathy without knowing
                            it until vision loss occurs.</li>
                        <li><strong>Preventable:</strong> Good blood sugar control can prevent or delay diabetic
                            retinopathy by up to 76%.</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatable:</strong> Early detection and timely treatment can prevent 95% of vision
                            loss from diabetic retinopathy.</li>
                        <li><strong>Affects both eyes:</strong> Diabetic retinopathy typically affects both eyes.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>Understanding diabetic retinopathy and taking proactive steps to protect your vision is crucial for
                    everyone with diabetes. Regular comprehensive dilated eye exams are your best defense against vision
                    loss from this condition.</p>

                <h2>How Diabetes Affects the Eyes</h2>
                <p>To understand diabetic retinopathy, it helps to know how diabetes affects your eyes:</p>

                <h3>The Retina and Blood Vessels</h3>
                <p>The retina contains a complex network of tiny blood vessels (capillaries) that provide oxygen and
                    nutrients to the light-sensitive retinal tissue. These blood vessels are some of the smallest in
                    your body and are particularly vulnerable to damage from high blood sugar levels.</p>

                <h3>How High Blood Sugar Causes Damage</h3>
                <p>When blood sugar levels remain elevated over time, several harmful processes occur:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Blood vessel weakening:</strong> High glucose levels damage the walls of retinal blood
                        vessels, making them weak and prone to leakage.</li>
                    <li><strong>Protein glycation:</strong> Excess sugar attaches to proteins in blood vessel walls,
                        weakening their structure.</li>
                    <li><strong>Inflammation:</strong> Chronic high blood sugar triggers inflammatory processes that
                        damage vessel linings.</li>
                    <li><strong>Reduced blood flow:</strong> Damaged vessels may close off, depriving areas of the
                        retina of oxygen and nutrients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Abnormal vessel growth:</strong> In response to poor oxygen supply, the retina may grow
                        new, abnormal blood vessels that are fragile and leak easily.</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Progressive Damage</h3>
                <p>Diabetic retinopathy progresses through stages, starting with minor blood vessel abnormalities and
                    potentially advancing to sight-threatening complications including:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Retinal swelling (macular edema)</li>
                    <li>Bleeding into the vitreous (vitreous hemorrhage)</li>
                    <li>Retinal detachment</li>
                    <li>Glaucoma from abnormal blood vessel growth</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="types">
                <h2>Types and Stages of Diabetic Retinopathy</h2>
                <p>Diabetic retinopathy is classified into two main types with progressive stages:</p>

                <h3>Non-Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (NPDR)</h3>
                <p>This is the early stage where retinal blood vessels are damaged but new abnormal vessels haven't
                    formed yet. NPDR has three levels of severity:</p>

                <h4>Mild NPDR</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microaneurysms (tiny bulges in blood vessel walls) appear</li>
                    <li>Usually no symptoms</li>
                    <li>Vision typically unaffected</li>
                    <li>Detected only through eye examination</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Moderate NPDR</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>More blood vessels become blocked</li>
                    <li>Blood vessel walls weaken further</li>
                    <li>Retinal swelling may begin (macular edema)</li>
                    <li>Mild vision changes may occur if macula is affected</li>
                    <li>Increases risk of progression to severe stages</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Severe NPDR</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Many more blood vessels are blocked</li>
                    <li>Large areas of retina lose their blood supply</li>
                    <li>Retina sends signals to grow new blood vessels</li>
                    <li>High risk of progressing to proliferative DR</li>
                    <li>Vision may begin to decline if macula is involved</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy (PDR)</h3>
                <p>This is the advanced, more dangerous stage where new abnormal blood vessels grow on the retina's
                    surface or into the vitreous gel. PDR can lead to severe vision loss and blindness.</p>

                <h4>Characteristics of PDR:</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Neovascularization:</strong> New, fragile blood vessels grow in response to poor oxygen
                        supply (ischemia)</li>
                    <li><strong>Vitreous hemorrhage:</strong> New vessels are weak and bleed easily into the vitreous,
                        causing sudden vision loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Tractional retinal detachment:</strong> Scar tissue from bleeding can pull the retina
                        away from the back of the eye</li>
                    <li><strong>Neovascular glaucoma:</strong> New vessels can grow on the iris, blocking fluid drainage
                        and causing dangerous pressure buildup</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Diabetic Macular Edema (DME)</h3>
                <p>DME is a complication that can occur at any stage of diabetic retinopathy. It happens when fluid
                    leaks from damaged blood vessels into the macula (the central part of the retina responsible for
                    sharp vision), causing swelling.</p>

                <p><strong>Impact of DME:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can occur in NPDR or PDR</li>
                    <li>Leading cause of vision loss in diabetic retinopathy</li>
                    <li>Causes blurred, distorted central vision</li>
                    <li>May develop slowly or rapidly</li>
                    <li>Treatable with anti-VEGF injections, steroids, or laser</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="causes">
                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>The primary cause of diabetic retinopathy is prolonged elevation of blood sugar levels. However,
                    multiple factors influence who develops DR and how quickly it progresses:</p>

                <h3>Primary Causes</h3>

                <h4>Poor Blood Sugar Control</h4>
                <p>High blood glucose (hyperglycemia) over time is the main driver. The Diabetes Control and
                    Complications Trial (DCCT) showed that intensive blood sugar control reduces diabetic retinopathy
                    risk by 76% and slows progression by 54%.</p>

                <h4>Duration of Diabetes</h4>
                <p>The longer you have diabetes, the higher your risk:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>After 5 years: ~25% of Type 1 diabetics have some DR</li>
                    <li>After 10 years: ~60% of Type 1 diabetics have some DR</li>
                    <li>After 15 years: ~80% of Type 1 diabetics have some DR</li>
                    <li>After 20 years: Nearly 100% of Type 1 and 60% of Type 2 diabetics have some degree of DR</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Major Risk Factors</h3>

                <h4>Poor Glycemic Control</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>High HbA1c levels (>7%)</li>
                    <li>Frequent blood sugar fluctuations</li>
                    <li>Poorly managed diabetes</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>High Blood Pressure (Hypertension)</h4>
                <p>Adds additional stress to already weakened blood vessels. Good blood pressure control (< 140/90 mmHg)
                        reduces DR progression risk by 34%.</p>

                        <h4>High Cholesterol and Lipids</h4>
                        <p>Elevated cholesterol, especially LDL cholesterol and triglycerides, increases risk of hard
                            exudates (lipid deposits) in the retina and macular edema.</p>

                        <h4>Kidney Disease (Diabetic Nephropathy)</h4>
                        <p>People with diabetic kidney disease have a higher risk of diabetic retinopathy, as both are
                            microvascular complications.</p>

                        <h4>Pregnancy</h4>
                        <p>Pregnancy can accelerate diabetic retinopathy, especially if blood sugar control is poor.
                            Pregnant women with diabetes need more frequent eye exams.</p>

                        <h4>Smoking</h4>
                        <p>Smoking damages blood vessels throughout the body, including the eyes, and increases DR risk.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Race and Ethnicity</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li>African Americans, Hispanics, and Native Americans have higher rates of diabetic
                                retinopathy</li>
                            <li>May be related to higher diabetes prevalence and access to care</li>
                        </ul>

                        <h4>Rapid Improvement in Blood Sugar</h4>
                        <p>Paradoxically, rapidly improving blood sugar control after years of poor control can
                            temporarily worsen retinopathy. This is why gradual improvement is sometimes recommended
                            under medical supervision.</p>

                <h3>Diagnostic Tests</h3>

                <h4>1. Comprehensive Dilated Eye Exam</h4>
                <p>The gold standard for DR detection. Eye drops dilate your pupils, allowing examination of the retina
                    for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Microaneurysms and hemorrhages</li>
                    <li>Blood vessel abnormalities</li>
                    <li>Retinal swelling</li>
                    <li>Fatty deposits (hard exudates)</li>
                    <li>New abnormal blood vessels</li>
                    <li>Retinal detachment</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>2. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h4>
                <p>Non-invasive imaging that creates cross-sectional images of the retina. OCT is essential for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Detecting and measuring macular edema</li>
                    <li>Monitoring DR progression</li>
                    <li>Assessing response to treatment</li>
                    <li>Visualizing retinal layers in detail</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Fluorescein Angiography (FA)</h4>
                <p>A dye is injected into your arm and photographs are taken as it passes through retinal blood vessels.
                    FA shows:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Leaking blood vessels</li>
                    <li>Areas of poor blood flow (ischemia)</li>
                    <li>Abnormal new blood vessel growth</li>
                    <li>The extent of retinal damage</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>4. OCT Angiography (OCTA)</h4>
                <p>A newer, non-invasive alternative to FA that shows blood flow without dye injection.</p>

                <h4>5. Fundus Photography</h4>
                <p>Color photographs of the retina create a baseline for tracking changes over time.</p>

                <h4>6. Visual Acuity Test</h4>
                <p>Measures how well you can see at various distances to detect vision loss.</p>

                <h4>7. Tonometry</h4>
                <p>Measures eye pressure to screen for glaucoma, which can occur with advanced DR.</p>

                <h3>DR Severity Staging</h3>
                <p>Based on exam findings, your doctor will classify DR severity:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>No DR:</strong> No abnormalities</li>
                    <li><strong>Mild NPDR:</strong> Microaneurysms only</li>
                    <li><strong>Moderate NPDR:</strong> More extensive changes</li>
                    <li><strong>Severe NPDR:</strong> Extensive hemorrhages and vessel abnormalities</li>
                    <li><strong>PDR:</strong> Neovascularization present</li>
                    <li><strong>DME:</strong> Noted separately at any stage</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="treatment">
                <h2>Treatment Options</h2>
                <p>Treatment depends on the stage and severity of diabetic retinopathy. The goals are to slow or stop
                    progression and preserve vision.</p>

                <h3>Medical Management (All Stages)</h3>

                <h4>Blood Sugar Control</h4>
                <p>The single most important intervention:</p>
                <ul>

                    <li>Regular exercise</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Blood Pressure Control</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Target < 140/90 mmHg (< 130/80 for some patients)</li>
                    <li>Reduces DR progression by 34%</li>
                    <li>Antihypertensive medications as needed</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Lipid Management</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Control cholesterol and triglycerides</li>

                    <li>Fenofibrate may slow DR progression</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment for Diabetic Macular Edema</h3>

                <h4>Anti-VEGF Injections</h4>
                <p>The primary treatment for DME. These medications block vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF),
                    reducing vessel leakage and swelling:</p>

                <p><strong>Common anti-VEGF medications:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Aflibercept (Eylea):</strong> Often first choice, typically every 4-8 weeks</li>
                    <li><strong>Ranibizumab (Lucentis):</strong> Monthly or as needed</li>
                    <li><strong>Bevacizumab (Avastin):</strong> Off-label, cost-effective option</li>
                    <li><strong>Faricimab (Vabysmo):</strong> Newer agent allowing extended dosing</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>What to expect:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Injections performed in office with numbing drops</li>
                    <li>Initial loading phase of monthly injections</li>
                    <li>Maintenance phase with less frequent injections</li>
                    <li>OCT monitoring to guide treatment</li>
                    <li>About 40-50% of patients improve 2+ lines of vision</li>
                    <li>90% maintain vision</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Corticosteroid Injections/Implants</h4>
                <p>Steroid medications reduce inflammation and vessel leakage:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Triamcinolone:</strong> Injection lasting 1-3 months</li>
                    <li><strong>Dexamethasone implant (Ozurdex):</strong> Lasts 3-6 months</li>
                    <li><strong>Fluocinolone implant (Iluvien, Retisert):</strong> Lasts up to 3 years</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Considerations:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Risk of increased eye pressure (glaucoma)</li>
                    <li>Risk of cataract formation</li>
                    <li>Often used when anti-VEGF doesn't work well</li>
                    <li>May be combined with anti-VEGF</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Focal/Grid Laser Photocoagulation</h4>
                <p>Laser treatment to seal leaking blood vessels in DME:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Used less frequently now that injections are available</li>
                    <li>May be combined with anti-VEGF injections</li>
                    <li>Reduces moderate vision loss by 50%</li>
                    <li>Performed in office, usually painless</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Treatment for Proliferative Diabetic Retinopathy</h3>

                <h4>Panretinal Photocoagulation (PRP)</h4>
                <p>Scatter laser treatment that shrinks abnormal blood vessels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>1,200-2,000 laser spots applied to peripheral retina</li>
                    <li>Reduces oxygen demand, stopping new vessel growth</li>
                    <li>Usually done in 1-2 sessions</li>
                    <li>May cause some peripheral vision loss (trade-off for saving central vision)</li>
                    <li>Night vision may be affected</li>
                    <li>Prevents severe vision loss in >90% of cases</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Anti-VEGF Injections for PDR</h4>
                <p>Increasingly used as alternative or addition to laser:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Can cause rapid regression of new vessels</li>
                    <li>May avoid or reduce need for laser</li>
                    <li>Requires ongoing injections</li>
