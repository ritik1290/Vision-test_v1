                <h2>What Is Glaucoma?</h2>
                <p>Glaucoma is a group of eye diseases that damage the optic nerve, which is crucial for transmitting
                    visual information from your eye to your brain. This damage is often, but not always, caused by
                    abnormally high pressure inside the eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). Glaucoma is one of the
                    leading causes of blindness worldwide, particularly among older adults.</p>

                <p>What makes glaucoma particularly dangerous is that it often develops gradually with no early warning
                    signs or symptoms. The disease can steal your sight so gradually that you may not notice vision loss
                    until the condition is at an advanced stage. This is why glaucoma is often called "the silent thief
                    of sight."</p>

                <div class="key-facts">
                    <h3><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Key Facts About Glaucoma</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Second leading cause of blindness:</strong> Glaucoma is the second leading cause of
                            blindness globally, affecting over 70 million people worldwide.</li>
                        <li><strong>Irreversible damage:</strong> Vision loss from glaucoma cannot be recovered.
                            However, with early detection and treatment, vision loss can be slowed or prevented.</li>
                        <li><strong>Often symptomless:</strong> Most types of glaucoma have no early symptoms, making
                            regular eye exams crucial.</li>
                        <li><strong>Hereditary component:</strong> Having a family history of glaucoma increases your
                            risk four to nine times.</li>
                        <li><strong>Age factor:</strong> People over 60 are at increased risk, though glaucoma can occur
                            at any age.</li>
                        <li><strong>Treatable but not curable:</strong> While glaucoma cannot be cured, it can usually
                            be controlled with treatment to prevent further vision loss.</li>
                    </ul>
                </div>

                <p>The good news is that if caught early, glaucoma can usually be controlled, and vision loss can be
                    minimized or prevented through medication, laser treatment, or surgery. Regular comprehensive eye
                    exams are essential for early detection, especially if you have risk factors for the disease.</p>

            <section id="anatomy">
                <h2>Understanding Eye Pressure and the Optic Nerve</h2>
                <p>To understand glaucoma, it's essential to know how eye pressure and the optic nerve work:</p>

                <h3>Intraocular Pressure (IOP)</h3>
                <p>Your eye is filled with fluid that maintains its shape and provides nutrients to internal structures.
                    The front part of the eye is filled with a clear fluid called aqueous humor. This fluid is
                    constantly produced by the ciliary body and drains out through a mesh-like drainage system called
                    the trabecular meshwork, located in the angle where the iris meets the cornea.</p>

                <p>When this drainage system works properly, the production and drainage of aqueous humor are balanced,
                    maintaining a healthy eye pressure (normal range: 12-22 mmHg). However, if the drainage system
                    becomes blocked or inefficient, fluid builds up, causing increased pressure inside the eye.</p>

                <h3>The Optic Nerve</h3>
                <p>The optic nerve is made up of more than a million nerve fibers that connect the retina to the brain.
                    It acts like a cable transmitting images from your eye to your brain, which interprets these signals
                    as vision. Damage to the optic nerve results in irreversible vision loss.</p>

                <h3>How Glaucoma Affects Vision</h3>
                <p>Elevated intraocular pressure can damage the optic nerve by:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Compressing nerve fibers</li>
                    <li>Reducing blood flow to the nerve</li>
                    <li>Causing mechanical stress on the nerve tissue</li>
                </ul>

                <p>As nerve fibers are damaged and die, blind spots develop in your visual field. These blind spots
                    typically begin in the peripheral (side) vision. If the entire nerve is destroyed, blindness
                    results. Importantly, some people can have elevated eye pressure without developing glaucoma (ocular
                    hypertension), while others develop glaucoma even with normal eye pressure (normal-tension
                    glaucoma).</p>
            </section>

            <section id="types">
                <h2>Types of Glaucoma</h2>
                <p>There are several types of glaucoma, each with different causes and characteristics:</p>

                <h3>1. Primary Open-Angle Glaucoma (POAG)</h3>
                <p>This is the most common form of glaucoma, accounting for about 90% of all cases. It's called
                    "open-angle" because the drainage angle (where the iris meets the cornea) remains open, but the
                    trabecular meshwork is partially blocked, causing gradual pressure buildup.</p>

                <p><strong>Characteristics:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develops slowly and painlessly</li>
                    <li>No early warning signs</li>
                    <li>Peripheral vision is affected first</li>
                    <li>If untreated, progresses to central vision loss and blindness</li>
                    <li>Usually affects both eyes, though one may be more severely affected</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>2. Angle-Closure Glaucoma (Acute/Narrow-Angle Glaucoma)</h3>
                <p>This type occurs when the drainage angle becomes blocked or covered by part of the iris. This can
                    happen suddenly (acute angle-closure glaucoma) or develop gradually (chronic angle-closure
                    glaucoma).</p>

                <p><strong>Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Medical emergency requiring immediate treatment</li>
                    <li>Sudden, severe symptoms</li>
                    <li>Intense eye pain and headache</li>
                    <li>Nausea and vomiting</li>
                    <li>Blurred vision and halos around lights</li>
                    <li>Eye redness</li>
                    <li>Can cause permanent vision loss if not treated quickly</li>
                </ul>

                <p><strong>Chronic Angle-Closure Glaucoma:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Develops slowly with few or no symptoms</li>
                    <li>Drainage angle gradually narrows</li>
                    <li>May go unnoticed until significant damage occurs</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>3. Normal-Tension Glaucoma (Low-Tension Glaucoma)</h3>
                <p>In this form of glaucoma, the optic nerve is damaged even though eye pressure remains within the
                    normal range. The exact cause is unknown, but may involve poor blood flow to the optic nerve or
                    structural weakness of the nerve.</p>

                <p><strong>Risk Factors:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Japanese ancestry</li>
                    <li>Family history of normal-tension glaucoma</li>
                    <li>History of cardiovascular disease</li>
                    <li>Low blood pressure</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>4. Secondary Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>This type results from other eye conditions or medical problems. Causes include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eye injuries or trauma</li>
                    <li>Eye inflammation (uveitis)</li>
                    <li>Advanced cataracts</li>
                    <li>Eye tumors</li>
                    <li>Diabetes (neovascular glaucoma)</li>
                    <li>Corticosteroid use</li>
                    <li>Eye surgery complications</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>5. Congenital/Pediatric Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>This rare form occurs in babies and young children due to incorrect or incomplete development of the
                    eye's drainage system before birth.</p>

                <p><strong>Signs in infants:</strong></p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cloudy eyes</li>
                    <li>Excessive tearing</li>
                    <li>Sensitivity to light</li>
                    <li>Enlarged eyes</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>6. Pigmentary Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>This rare form occurs when pigment granules from the iris build up in the drainage channels, blocking
                    fluid outflow and increasing eye pressure. It typically affects nearsighted men in their 20s to 40s.

                <h2>Causes and Risk Factors</h2>
                <p>While the exact cause of glaucoma isn't always clear, several factors increase your risk:</p>

                <h3>Major Risk Factors You Cannot Control</h3>

                <h4>Age</h4>
                <p>Risk increases significantly after age 60. For African Americans, the increased risk begins after age
                    40.</p>

                <h4>Family History</h4>
                <p>Having a parent or sibling with glaucoma increases your risk four to nine times. Certain genetic
                    mutations have been linked to glaucoma.</p>

                <h4>Race and Ethnicity</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>African Americans:</strong> Six to eight times more likely to develop glaucoma than
                        Caucasians, at a younger age, and with more severe vision loss</li>
                    <li><strong>Hispanics/Latinos:</strong> At higher risk, especially after age 60</li>
                    <li><strong>Asians:</strong> Higher risk of angle-closure glaucoma</li>
                    <li><strong>Japanese:</strong> Higher risk of normal-tension glaucoma</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Anatomical Factors</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Thin central cornea</li>
                    <li>Optic nerve sensitivity</li>
                    <li>Narrow drainage angle</li>
                    <li>Thin or large optic nerve</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Medical Conditions That Increase Risk</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>High eye pressure</strong> (though not everyone with high pressure develops glaucoma)
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Diabetes:</strong> Increases risk of several types of glaucoma</li>
                    <li><strong>High blood pressure</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Heart disease</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Hypothyroidism</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Migraines</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Sickle cell anemia</strong></li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Other Risk Factors</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Eye injuries:</strong> Trauma can cause immediate or delayed glaucoma</li>
                    <li><strong>Previous eye surgery</strong></li>
                    <li><strong>Severe myopia (nearsightedness):</strong> Increases risk for open-angle glaucoma</li>
                    <li><strong>Hyperopia (farsightedness):</strong> Increases risk for angle-closure glaucoma</li>
                    <li><strong>Long-term corticosteroid use:</strong> Especially eye drops</li>
                    <li><strong>Prolonged eye drop use:</strong> Some medications can affect eye pressure</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Diagnosis and Testing</h2>
                <p>Comprehensive eye examination is the only way to detect glaucoma. A complete glaucoma evaluation
                    includes several tests:</p>

                <h3>Essential Diagnostic Tests</h3>

                <h4>1. Tonometry (Eye Pressure Measurement)</h4>
                <p>This test measures the pressure inside your eye (intraocular pressure or IOP). Several methods exist:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Applanation tonometry:</strong> The most common method, using a special device to gently
                        flatten a portion of your cornea</li>
                    <li><strong>Non-contact tonometry (air-puff test):</strong> Uses a puff of air to measure pressure
                    </li>
                    <li><strong>Electronic tonometry:</strong> A handheld device that touches the eye briefly</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Normal eye pressure ranges from 12 to 22 mmHg, though some people develop glaucoma with normal
                    pressure, and others can have high pressure without glaucoma.</p>

                <h4>2. Ophthalmoscopy (Optic Nerve Examination)</h4>
                <p>Your eye doctor examines the optic nerve for damage by looking inside your eye with a special
                    magnifying instrument called an ophthalmoscope. Signs of glaucoma include:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Cupping of the optic disc (hollowing or deepening)</li>
                    <li>Changes in color of the optic nerve</li>
                    <li>Bleeding</li>
                    <li>Other abnormalities</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>3. Visual Field Test (Perimetry)</h4>
                <p>This test checks for blind spots in your peripheral and central vision. You'll look straight ahead
                    while lights flash in your peripheral vision, and you'll indicate when you can see them. This test
                    can detect even subtle vision changes and help monitor glaucoma progression.</p>

                <h4>4. Gonioscopy</h4>
                <p>This test examines the drainage angle of your eye where fluid drains out. A special contact lens with
                    a mirror is placed on your eye to allow the doctor to see if the angle is open, narrow, or closed.
                    This helps determine the type of glaucoma.</p>

                <h4>5. Pachymetry (Corneal Thickness Measurement)</h4>
                <p>This quick, painless test measures the thickness of your cornea using ultrasound. People with thinner
                    corneas may be at higher risk for glaucoma, and corneal thickness can affect eye pressure readings.
                </p>

                <h4>6. Optical Coherence Tomography (OCT)</h4>
                <p>This advanced imaging test creates detailed, cross-sectional images of the optic nerve and retina. It
                    can detect nerve fiber damage before vision loss occurs and is useful for monitoring disease
                    progression.</p>

                <h4>7. Optic Nerve Photography</h4>
                <p>Photos of your optic nerve provide a baseline for comparing future exams and tracking changes over
                    time.</p>

                <h3>Screening Recommendations</h3>
                <p>The American Academy of Ophthalmology recommends comprehensive eye examinations:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Under 40 with risk factors:</strong> Every 2-4 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Age 40-54:</strong> Every 2-4 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Age 55-64:</strong> Every 1-3 years</li>
                    <li><strong>Age 65 and older:</strong> Every 1-2 years</li>
                    <li><strong>High-risk individuals:</strong> Annually or as recommended by your doctor</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="treatment">
                <h2>Treatment Goals and Options</h2>
                <p>The goal of glaucoma treatment is to prevent further vision loss by lowering eye pressure or
                    improving blood flow to the optic nerve. The damage already done cannot be reversed, making early
                    detection and treatment crucial.</p>

                <h3>Treatment Approaches</h3>
                <p>Treatment options include medications, laser therapy, and surgery. Your doctor will recommend
                    treatment based on:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Type and severity of glaucoma</li>
                    <li>Current eye pressure</li>
                    <li>Rate of disease progression</li>
                    <li>Overall health and ability to comply with treatment</li>
                    <li>Potential side effects</li>
                    <li>Cost and insurance coverage</li>
                </ul>

                <div class="alert-box info">
                    <h4><i class="fas fa-info-circle"></i> Treatment Is Lifelong</h4>
                    <p>Glaucoma is a chronic condition requiring lifelong treatment and monitoring. Even if your eye
                        pressure normalizes with treatment, you'll need to continue therapy and regular checkups.
                        Stopping treatment can lead to rapid progression of vision loss.</p>

                <h2>Medications and Eye Drops</h2>
                <p>Eye drops are usually the first line of treatment for glaucoma. They work by either decreasing fluid
                    production in the eye or improving fluid drainage. Sometimes oral medications are prescribed as
                    well.</p>

                <h3>Tips for Using Eye Drops Correctly</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands before applying drops</li>
                    <li>Tilt your head back or lie down</li>
                    <li>Pull down your lower eyelid to create a pocket</li>
                    <li>Look up and squeeze one drop into the pocket</li>
                    <li>Close your eye gently for 1-2 minutes</li>
                    <li>Press gently on the inner corner of your eye to prevent drainage</li>
                    <li>Wait at least 5 minutes between different eye drops</li>
                    <li>Don't touch the dropper tip to anything</li>
                    <li>Use drops exactly as prescribed, even if you feel fine</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Oral Medications</h3>
                <p>If eye drops aren't sufficient, oral carbonic anhydrase inhibitors (acetazolamide, methazolamide) may
                    be prescribed. These medications are particularly useful for acute angle-closure glaucoma. Side
                    effects can include frequent urination, tingling in fingers and toes, loss of appetite, and kidney
                    stones with long-term use.</p>

            <section id="surgery">
                <h2>Laser Therapy and Surgical Options</h2>
                <p>If medications don't adequately control eye pressure or you can't tolerate them, your doctor may
                    recommend laser treatment or surgery.</p>

                <h3>Laser Procedures</h3>

                <h4>1. Laser Trabeculoplasty</h4>
                <p>Used for open-angle glaucoma, this procedure uses a laser to improve drainage through the trabecular
                    meshwork.</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>SLT (Selective Laser Trabeculoplasty):</strong> Uses low-energy laser pulses, can be
                        repeated</li>
                    <li><strong>ALT (Argon Laser Trabeculoplasty):</strong> Older technique, less commonly used now</li>
                </ul>
                <p>The procedure is painless, takes about 10-15 minutes, and can reduce or eliminate the need for eye
                    drops. Effects may last several years but can diminish over time.</p>

                <h4>2. Laser Peripheral Iridotomy (LPI)</h4>
                <p>Used primarily for angle-closure glaucoma, the laser creates a small hole in the iris to allow fluid
                    to flow more freely. This procedure prevents or treats acute angle-closure attacks and is often
                    recommended preventively for narrow angles.</p>

                <h4>3. Laser Cyclophotocoagulation</h4>
                <p>Used when other treatments have failed, this laser treats the ciliary body (which produces aqueous
                    fluid), reducing fluid production. It's typically reserved for severe cases.</p>

                <h3>Incisional Surgery</h3>

                <h4>1. Trabeculectomy</h4>
                <p>The most common glaucoma surgery, trabeculectomy creates a new drainage channel for fluid to leave
                    the eye. The surgeon makes a small flap in the sclera (white of the eye) and creates a filtration
                    bleb (a small bubble) where fluid can collect and drain.</p>

                <p><strong>Success rate:</strong> About 60-80% of patients maintain good pressure control for 3-5 years.
                    The procedure can be repeated if necessary.</p>

                <h4>2. Glaucoma Drainage Implants (Tube Shunts)</h4>
                <p>A small tube is inserted into the eye to help drain fluid. This is often used when trabeculectomy has
                    failed or is likely to fail.</p>

                <h4>3. Minimally Invasive Glaucoma Surgery (MIGS)</h4>
                <p>Newer techniques that are less invasive with faster recovery:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>iStent:</strong> Tiny stent placed in the drainage angle</li>
                    <li><strong>Trabectome:</strong> Removes part of the trabecular meshwork</li>
                    <li><strong>XEN Gel Stent:</strong> Soft, gel-like tube that creates a drainage pathway</li>
                    <li><strong>Kahook Dual Blade:</strong> Removes a strip of trabecular meshwork</li>
                </ul>

                <p>MIGS procedures have lower risk profiles than traditional surgery but may not lower pressure as
                    dramatically. They're often performed during cataract surgery.</p>

                <h3>Surgery for Acute Angle-Closure Glaucoma</h3>
                <p>Acute angle-closure glaucoma is a medical emergency requiring immediate treatment:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Immediate medications to lower eye pressure</li>
                    <li>Laser peripheral iridotomy as soon as inflammation subsides</li>
                    <li>Often preventive treatment in the other eye</li>
                </ul>
            </section>

            <section id="living">
                <h2>Living with Glaucoma</h2>
                <p>A glaucoma diagnosis can be overwhelming, but with proper treatment and lifestyle adjustments, most
                    people with glaucoma can maintain their vision and quality of life.</p>

                <h3>Medication Adherence</h3>
                <p>One of the biggest challenges with glaucoma is remembering to use eye drops consistently:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Set daily alarms or reminders</li>
                    <li>Link drops to daily routines (brushing teeth, meals)</li>
                    <li>Keep drops in a visible location</li>
                    <li>Use a medication tracking app</li>
                    <li>Ask your pharmacist about reminder services</li>
                    <li>If you miss a dose, use it as soon as you remember, but don't double up</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Lifestyle Modifications</h3>

                <h4>Exercise</h4>
                <p>Regular aerobic exercise can help lower eye pressure. However:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Start slowly and build up gradually</li>
                    <li>Avoid exercises that involve head-down positions (some yoga poses, headstands)</li>
                    <li>Be cautious with activities that involve breath-holding</li>
                    <li>Stay hydrated during exercise</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Diet and Nutrition</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Eat a healthy diet rich in green leafy vegetables</li>
                    <li>Omega-3 fatty acids may be beneficial (fish, flaxseed)</li>
                    <li>Limit caffeine intake (can temporarily raise eye pressure)</li>
                    <li>Avoid drinking large amounts of fluid quickly</li>
                    <li>Maintain a healthy weight</li>
                </ul>

                <h4>Eye Protection</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wear protective eyewear during sports and activities that risk eye injury</li>
                    <li>Wear sunglasses to protect from UV rays</li>
                    <li>Sleep with your head elevated (may help reduce pressure in some cases)</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Emotional and Mental Health</h3>
                <p>Living with a chronic condition affecting your vision can be stressful:</p>
